TextViewDelegate
==============

ABOUT:

This application demonstrates the use of the text view's delegate to control selection 
  and user input.  We use an unmodified text view, except that as its delegate we make
  sure that whenever a return is entered, the text that has been typed up to that point
  is colored red, and is recorded as committed, so that no further changes are allowed 
  to it.
